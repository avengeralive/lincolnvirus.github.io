The “REAl manual hedge” system is a convenient auxiliary trading tool that allows to make the hedging function of open positions automatic.  

The system is managed by a convenient data and command board.  

By using action buttons, you can open a market order (“B” - Buy “S” - Sell), pending stop orders (“BS”, BuyStop, “SS” - SellStop), limit orders (“BL” - BuyLimit, “SL” - SellLimit). To close working market order (“CB” Close Buy “CS” - Close Sell), delete active pending orders (“DB” - Delete Buy, “DS” - Delete Sell) and clear order book with one click (“CA” - Close All).  

The first order of a series will be opened with a fixed “initial lot” (to be set in the settings), each of the following orders will be opened with X time larger lot (lot multiplier can be found in the settings).  

During operation, the “at-the-money” level (solid line) and the Take Profit level (to be set in the settings) are shown for an order series (dotted line).  

Technical advisor is adapted to work with 4 and 5-digit quotes.  

Additional features of the data and command board:

  - Ability to use a mouse (double click on title and move);
  - Ability to choose the language for information display (Russian/English);
  - Ability to use it in all time frames;
  - Ability to use it together with all trading instruments;
  - Information on current state of the account (balance, funds, spread);
  - Information on system results (current profit / loss, per day, for the whole period of operation);
  - Information on current trading state (number of open orders, volume, profit/loss).
  
**A nice feature** - ability of full-rate operation in a strategy tester mode. Test your trading system in a tester simulating a real market!
