**Strategy:**

“REAl save” - a tool to close losing positions by a managed lock.  
The system uses two levels of locking orders that allow to reduce a lock size when the price moves in the main position’s direction. There is also a compensation mechanism that allows you to make a profit even when the price moves against the main position, as increasing reversal potential to speed up liquidation of an adverse position. The order group is closed at the “at-the-money + determined profit” level.

**Keyelements:**
  - Level settings, lot size and target profit amount of locking orders;
  - Level setting and lot size of an additional order;
  - Target profit setting for an order group;
  - Ability to work using your own market entry strategy;
  - Ability to manage orders that have already been opened;
  - System of order volume calculation;
  - Technical adviser is adapted to work with 4 and 5-digit quotes;
  - Ability to use it in all time frames;
  - Ability to use it together with all trading instruments;
  - Information panel.
