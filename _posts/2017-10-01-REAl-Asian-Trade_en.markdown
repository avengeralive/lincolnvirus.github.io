On the 1st of October 2017 the new technical adviser «REAl Asian trade» was brought into operation. 

Tests showed successful results which allowed running it for charity. 

I would like to thank Vladimir Blednov a lot for developing the technical adviser «REAl Asian trade».

I would like to thank Maxim Kirillov (Russian Federation), Raphael Ferreira Minato (Brazil), WEI ZHE (China) for the help in testing. 

Gratitude to all who is not indifferent to sick children and helps in different ways. 

The project «Lincoln virus» seeks to help all people who needs help, and unites everyone who is not indifferent to people’s lives.
