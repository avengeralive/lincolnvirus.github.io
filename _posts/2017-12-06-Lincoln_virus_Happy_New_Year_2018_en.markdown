Happy New Year to you all!

Let the Year of the Dog bring even more good.
A dog - man's most faithful friend.
It will always come to the rescue.
Will never leave in trouble.
Be honest with others.
Love each other. 
Don’t hide your feelings, be open-hearted.
Help those who need help.

The project “Lincoln virus” is trying to strengthen human relationship and takes care of everyone who needs help. 
In the new year we will expand our activities to help even more.
There are not so many of us and we hope that our website will get even more friends who care about other lives. 

We wish everyone good health and long life!
