February 12, 2018 marked the one-year anniversary date of the project “Lincoln virus”!

During the first year we faced a lot of challenges.
The main one was to gather a team for the further development of the project. 
And we made it!

Thus far, we have implemented a number of technical advisors for Forex, which have started to operate in many countries all over the world. 
People from Russia, China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Italy and many other countries have started to join the project. 
Everyone is using his own hobby for good. 
We are constantly developing our business and attracting new friends. 
We don’t ask you for anything to join the project.
All we ask is to help children in any way you can.

Make people kind, bring happiness to everyone! 
Kindness and happiness are everywhere!
Not every virus is dangerous! 
“Lincoln virus” is a good virus!

Let us remind you, that the “Lincoln virus” project was named after the 16th president of the USA, Abraham Lincoln (12 February, 1809 year – 15 April, 1865 year).
